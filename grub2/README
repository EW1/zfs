Modern Fedora 19+ GRUB just needs to be rebuilt with libzfs present.

To ensure a proper build, apply the grub.spec.diff file in this directory
to the specfile of the upstream SRPM.  This will make the build fail
unless zfs-devel is installed, which is what you want.

This is still not enough to get the SRPM to work properly however. The
10_linux file that gets installed in /etc/grub.d has a bug.  To fix that
bug, you can apply the 10_linux.diff patch in this directory to that file.
It would be a great idea if this patch could be incorporated into the spec
file and properly applied when you build.

The grub_mkconfig_zfs_support.diff file is now obsolete in modern distros.
