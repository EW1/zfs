zfs systemd work

for debugging purposes
install linux
set it to start to rescue.arget
set plymouth to provide the standard sysvinit plugin
tell dracut to break during shutdown

------------------------------------------

i need to write two unit files:

one of them needs to collect the mounted file systems at time of shutdown (collect-mtab)
the other needs to collect the zfs file systems known to the system and its mountpoints (collect-zfs-mountpoints)

collect-mtab needs to run at shutdown before file systems are mounted
After=local-fs.target
WantedBy=local-fs.target
execstart=bin true
execstop=.../.../collect-mtab
type=oneshot

collect-zfs-mountpoints needs to run at any point during shutdown before any zpool exports
After=<list of zpool exports>
WantedBy=local-fs.target
execstart=bin true
execstop=.../.../collect-zfs-mountpoints

also, I need to write this:
also, after pool modifications with zpool or zfs comands, rewrite the cache of such devices



all the unit files must also be conditional to the presence of zfs on the system
