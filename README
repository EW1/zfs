TODO

1. make it so only the pool containing the root filesystem is imported.
because it can take a looong time to import all pools
a) some magic needed in genrules.sh to figure it out from the $root variable
b) remove zpool import -a from 90-zfs.rules after that

2. make it so the import of said root pool does not cause the filesystems to be automatically mounted
speed up the boot process

3. make it so the root filesystem needs not to be exactly specified (but works if it is specified)
a) essentially autodetect what filesystem of the known and importable pools is to be mounted on /
b) set the root variable up to point to that filesystem

4. initscript to run after mountall or mountotherfilesystems that will cause
the other auto filesystems to be mounted, and the legacy ones specified in fstab
